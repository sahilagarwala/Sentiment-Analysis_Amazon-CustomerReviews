414172,2,"This Or ""Dixie Chicken"" Presents Them At A Peak","Though lyrically the overall feel of this record is slightly provincial, it can still transport me to places I wanna be. Musically, this pop product from California is stylistically consistent. Yet the instrumentation is diverse and each member is resourceful. But it's Lowell George's vocals and slide guitar that are primarily at the center. He's not flashy and that's a positive. You get treated to 12-bar blues, a song of prescription meds for tripping and a blues with an accordian.But the three highlights are ""Easy To Slip"", a jaunty acoustic/electric number about lighting up and the sheer joy that memory drifting can project, ""Teenage Nervous Breakdown"" in which they switch to the domain of energy-driven rock and roll and the title track, a leisurely-paced country blues in which a generous helping of background vocals provides just the right amount of tension."
812231,2,"It's not perfect, but very good!","I have been looking for an anthology of outstanding literary material suggestions for a long time. I personally do not have much interest in current literature.Although not all the the classics are included, enough material is available for reference . If more books were available like this one it would not have the responsibility of including everything."
957100,2,Well done,"While the characters are not the same as in the original, the casting was well done and the players did a good job. In my view, this was a good sequel--both the book and the mini series. I highly recommend it, but not to those who would view it through a lens of too high expectations. It is what it is and what it is ain't all that bad. I'm grateful they did something rather than let the project lie dormant for fear of the critics."
990199,1,"Not so great, but pretty colors","I tried/own both the pink and the orangish colors and both work the same way. It is true that it goes on smooth and easy. You apply it with the pen and then smear it over your lips with your finger tip. However, the color wipes off easily even after letting it dry for over 15 minutes. I kept doing tests to see how long you had to leave it on before it would not wipe off, but even my 30 minute test did not work. The color still wipes off. I'm disappointed because the colors are really pretty but the stuff just won't stay put. I have to keep reapplying it all day long. I bought the two colors because the product came so highly recommended by Alive magazine, but just goes to show you that you can't believe everything you read."
1089873,1,Ruined My Valentine's Day!,"I read each Amazon review on this product before I made my purchase and so I had full confidence in using this product the night before Valentine's. BIG MISTAKE! I left it on for only 50 seconds and the next day I'm left with a line through my upper lip....I was embarrassed to walk outside with a red looking mustache!I put pure aloe vera on it in hopes for it to soothe the burning, but that was a challenge in itself as well. My face felt so tight, it hurt to open my mouth wide enough to eat anything.Today is day two and I see light peeling and my red mustache is now a dark brownish color. I hope this chemical didn't burn my skin and left a scar! :("

2050660,2,GREAT!!!!!,I got this toy a couple of days ago and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! It is so much more realistic looking than my other baby born comfort seat. All though I dont have a baby born I had one before but I sold it at a garage sale. So I use It for my berenguar baby doll. And it even has the buckle that goes across the shoulder like a real babies car seat!!!! DEFFINATELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!
2289210,2,Hot Coffee,Good coffee pot. Hot coffee. 6-8 cups makes a strong cup. 12-cup is not strong enough for me. Will pick up a timer & I'm good to go at the crack of dawn. My faberware kept dying and I've had a drip for 2 yrs. The drip was never hot. Nothing like perked coffee!
2460139,2,Mystery at Walt Disney World,"Book arrived in good condition, but took quite a bit longer to arrive than normal. Overall, I am very satisfied."
3356254,1,Take with a dose of skepticism...,"All readers should keep in mind that, as another reviewer noted, Arno Karlen is not an epidemiologist, biologist, or medical doctor.In fact, for a PSYCHOTHERAPIST, his analysis of the social consequences of disease are unfortunately short and rather insensitive, smacking of moralist judgment in several instances. Many of the anthropological theories he rests arguments upon are self-serving and little attention is given to alternatives. And really, is it ever appropriate to reference Biblical text as a source in a 'scientific' work??Overall, the book reads like an unending list of particular epidemiological incidents over human history, with a sensationally alarmist tone. Yes, it is a decent intro to human (and animal) epidemic history, but for any serious student of human health it leaves a lot to be desired. Furthermore, it is now outdated, being published in 1995, so readers should follow-up this book with some up-to-date research."
